# Archived Documentation

This folder contains historical documentation that is no longer actively maintained but preserved for reference.

## Structure

- **`planning/`** - Old planning documents, bug reports, and dependency graphs
- **`migration/`** - TypeScript to PureScript migration plans and port tracking
- **`audits/`** - Historical security audits, bug traces, and code reviews
- **`temp_files/`** - Temporary files from development sessions
- **`ui_temp/`** - Temporary UI files

## Why Archived?

These documents were created during active development phases and contain valuable historical context, but:

1. Information may be outdated
2. Plans may have changed or been completed
3. Some are internal-only development artifacts
