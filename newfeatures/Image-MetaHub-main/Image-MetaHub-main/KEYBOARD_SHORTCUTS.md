| `Ctrl/Cmd+2` | Focus Image Grid | Jump to image grid |
| `Ctrl/Cmd+3` | Focus Preview Pane | Jump to preview sidebar |

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Windows/Linux
- Use `Ctrl` for all shortcuts
- Numpad keys work same as regular number keys (Issue #48 fixed)
- `Alt+Enter` for fullscreen uses borderless maximize

### macOS
- Use `Cmd` (⌘) instead of `Ctrl`
- Native fullscreen animation with `Alt+Enter`
- Menu bar remains accessible in fullscreen

## Fixed Issues

- ✅ Issue #48: Numpad keys now work correctly on Linux
- ✅ Issue #21: Enter key now opens images without requiring grid focus
- ✅ Issue #26: Alt+Enter now properly closes modal when entering fullscreen
- ✅ Issue #24: Exit fullscreen button works after Alt+Enter (see previous fixes)
- ✅ Issue #25: Titlebar handled correctly in fullscreen (see previous fixes)
- ✅ Issue #15: Delete key now works reliably across all contexts

## Customization

Keyboard shortcuts can be customized in Settings > Keyboard Shortcuts. Changes are saved automatically and apply immediately.

## Technical Implementation

The keyboard system uses multiple layers for maximum compatibility:

1. **hotkeys-js** - Global shortcut manager with numpad support
2. **Component listeners** - Context-specific handlers (modal, grid, palette)
3. **Event coordination** - Prevents conflicts using stopPropagation and capture phase
4. **Cross-platform** - Unified behavior across Windows, Linux, and macOS
