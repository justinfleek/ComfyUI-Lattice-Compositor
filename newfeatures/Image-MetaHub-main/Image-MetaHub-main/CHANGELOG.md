## [0.12.0] - 2025-01-12

### Added

- **Smart Library Foundation - Image Clustering**: Revolutionary clustering system that organizes images into prompt-similarity stacks:
  - Background clustering worker with TF-IDF vectorization and hierarchical clustering
  - Multiple similarity metrics: Jaccard (token-based), Levenshtein (character-based), and hybrid scoring
  - Prompt normalization and FNV-1a hashing for efficient deduplication
  - Stack cards showing cover image, prompt preview, and image counts
  - StackExpandedView for browsing images within each cluster
  - Real-time progress streaming across clustering phases
  - File watcher integration: deletions automatically update clusters and remove empty ones
 
- **TF-IDF Auto-Tagging Engine**: Intelligent automatic tag generation from image metadata:
  - Metadata-weighted boosts for model and LoRA names for more relevant tags
  - ComfyUI workflow facts resolver for enhanced metadata extraction
  - Displayed in ImageModal and ImagePreviewSidebar
  - Auto-tag filtering with frequency counts
  - "Promote to tag" workflow to convert auto-tags into permanent tags
  - Per-tag removal capability

- **Enhanced Generation Workflow**: Comprehensive improvements to image generation modals and accessibility:
  - Generate dropdown in header for quick access to A1111 and ComfyUI generation from anywhere
  - Support for generation from scratch without requiring a base image
  - "Generate" option added to gallery context menu
  - Parameter persistence across sessions: model, LoRAs, cfg_scale, steps, randomSeed, and sampler/scheduler
  - "Load from Image" button to restore original image parameters after adjusting persisted values
  - Separated Sampler and Scheduler into distinct fields in ComfyUI modal (matching ComfyUI interface)

- **Smart Library UI**: Complete browsing interface for clustered images:
  - SmartLibrary.tsx with grid layout for stack cards
  - StackCard.tsx showing cover, prompt, and counts
  - Collections sidebar with filtering capabilities
  - Loading and empty states for better UX
  - Aligned with Gallery view for consistent experience
  - Reuses ImageGrid component for efficiency

  - Heuristic ranking: favorites -> file size -> creation date
  - Visual badges in ImageGrid for "best" vs "archived" images
  - Manual selection override support
  - Disk space savings estimation
  - Persistent deduplication preferences

### Changed

- **Directory Navigation**
 - Refactored root folder behavior to align with standard Explorer patterns. Clicking a root folder row now selects and filters its content directly instead of opening the system file explorer.
 - "Auto-watch" and recursive subfolder scanning are now enabled by default. New folders automatically index and watch all nested subdirectories.

### Improved

- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - Lazy thumbnail loading with IntersectionObserver for faster stack rendering
  - Increased thumbnail concurrency in thumbnailManager
  - Precomputed token/Jaccard filter to skip expensive Levenshtein comparisons

### Technical Improvements

- **ComfyUI Integration**: Extended comfyUIParser.ts with workflow facts resolver for better metadata extraction

## [0.11.1] - 2025-01-10

### Added

- **External Drag & Drop**: Enabled native drag and drop support for images in the Gallery View. Users can now directly drag images from the application to external programs (ComfyUI, Photoshop, Discord, file explorer, etc.) for a seamless workflow.

### Fixed

- **Forge Metadata Parsing**: Fixed "No normalized metadata available" issue for images created with newer Forge versions (f2.0.1+). The Forge backend update removed "Forge"/"Gradio" keywords from metadata, causing images to fall through to A1111 parser. Updated detection logic to recognize Forge version patterns (`/Version:\s*f\d+\./i`) in addition to keyword matching. (Issue #108)
- **Image Compare Mode - Hover & Slider**: Fixed critical rendering bug where images appeared as black screen in Hover and Slider comparison modes. The issue was caused by `react-zoom-pan-pinch` wrapper not receiving explicit height styles, causing the container to collapse to 0px height. Added `wrapperStyle` and `contentStyle` inline styles to force proper dimensions.

### Improved

- **Auto-Watch Instant Sync**: Activating auto-watch now triggers an immediate folder refresh, ensuring the gallery is instantly synchronized with the current directory state without waiting for the next file change event.
- **Image Compare Mode - Slider Interaction**: Significantly improved slider usability:
  - Expanded clickable area from 1px to 40px (20px on each side of the divider line) for much easier dragging
  - Removed 180ms transition delay during drag operations for instant response
  - Smooth transitions still apply when using keyboard or range input for fine adjustments

- **Enhanced LoRA Type Support**: Updated `BaseMetadata` interface to support both string and detailed LoRA info (`LoRAInfo`) with `name`, `model_name`, `weight`, `model_weight`, and `clip_weight` fields for comprehensive LoRA metadata handling
- **LoRA Weight Extraction**: All parsers (Automatic1111, Forge, SDNext, Fooocus, EasyDiffusion, DreamStudio, InvokeAI) now extract LoRA weights from `<lora:name:weight>` syntax and return structured `LoRAInfo` objects instead of plain strings
- **InvokeAI LoRA Weight Support**: InvokeAI parser now extracts weights from both prompt tags (`<lora:...>`, `<lyco:...>`) and InvokeAI's native metadata structure `{ model: { name }, weight }`
- **Preserve Original Prompts**: Removed automatic stripping of `<lora:...>` tags from prompts to preserve the user's original prompt text exactly as written. LoRAs are still extracted separately to the dedicated LoRAs field
- **ComfyUI Hybrid Parser Architecture**: Parser now uses a priority-based extraction system: (1) MetaHub chunk (instant, zero dependencies), (2) Graph traversal (fallback for standard ComfyUI exports), (3) Regex extraction (last resort). This eliminates the maintenance burden of updating nodeRegistry for new custom nodes
- **A1111 API Resource Fetching**: A1111 client now fetches and caches model and LoRA lists to power selection in the generation UI
- **Prioritized MetaHub Chunk Detection**: PNG parser now prioritizes MetaHub chunk detection for faster parsing of images saved with MetaHub Save Node

- Enhanced metadata display helpers: `formatGenerationTime()`, `formatVRAM()` with GPU percentage calculation
- Improved tag normalization and deduplication before import from MetaHub Save Node
- Fixed timing issues: tags now imported after images are added to store (flushPendingImages)
- Docker build improvements with LICENSE file inclusion and normalized image tags
- Updated CLI documentation with new output contracts and performance usage examples

## [0.10.5] - 2025-12-16

### Major Performance Improvements

- **3-5x Faster Loading**: Batch IPC operations reduce 1000+ individual calls to a single batch in cache loading and file operations
- **40-60% Fewer Re-renders**: Granular Zustand selectors optimize component updates across App.tsx, ComparisonModal.tsx, and ImageGrid.tsx
- **Phase B Optimizations**: Metadata enrichment now ~13ms per file (down from ~30ms) with header-based dimension reading, batch tuning, and optimized buffer reuse
- **Smoother Navigation**: Bounded thumbnail queue with stale request cancellation prevents outdated jobs from overwriting newer loads

### Added

- **Compare Modes: Slider & Hover**: New comparison modes alongside side-by-side: drag a divider to reveal each image or hover to flip between them, selectable via the mode toggle in the comparison header.
- **Mode-Aware Sync Controls**: Sync toggle is now clearly tied to side-by-side mode, with contextual hints per mode.

### Changed

- **Bounded Thumbnail Queue**: Thumbnail loading now uses a max-concurrency queue with cancellation of stale requests, preventing outdated jobs from overwriting newer loads during rapid navigation.
- **Debounced Full-Image Fallbacks**: Grid and table views delay heavy fallback reads by ~180ms when thumbnails aren't ready, reducing bursty I/O when paginating quickly.
- **Phase B Header Dimensions**: Metadata enrichment reads PNG/JPEG dimensions directly from file headers, skipping full image decode for width/height.
- **Phase B Batch Tuning**: Larger enrichment batches, timed dirty-chunk flushing, and parallel cache rewrites cut IPC/disk churn during metadata extraction.
- **Phase B Throughput Gains**: Optimized buffer reuse and looser flush thresholds dropped average Phase B time per file to ~13 ms on test sets

### Performance

- **Batch Path Joins**: Implemented batch IPC handler `join-paths-batch` for path joining operations, reducing 1000+ individual IPC calls to a single batch call in cache loading and file handle operations (3-5x faster).
- **Reduced JSON Operations**: Optimized `fileIndexer.ts` to skip `JSON.stringify` for empty rawMetadata objects, avoiding unnecessary serialization overhead.
- **Component Memoization**: Added `React.memo` to `Sidebar.tsx` and `ImagePreviewSidebar.tsx` components to prevent unnecessary re-renders when props haven't changed.
- **Granular Store Selectors**: Refactored `App.tsx`, `ComparisonModal.tsx`, and `ImageGrid.tsx` to use granular Zustand selectors instead of mass destructuring, reducing unnecessary re-renders by 40-60%.
- **Optimized ImageCard Memoization**: Replaced expensive `JSON.stringify()` tag comparison with efficient `join()` method in `ImageGrid.tsx`, improving grid rendering performance.
- **Memoized ImageTableRow**: Added `React.memo` with custom comparison to `ImageTableRow` component, preventing unnecessary re-renders in table view.
- **Optimized Table Sorting**: Wrapped `applySorting` function in `useCallback` to avoid recreation on every render, improving sorting performance for large datasets.
- **Throttled Drag-to-Select**: Implemented `requestAnimationFrame` throttling for drag-to-select intersection calculations, providing smoother UX without UI blocking.
- **Debounced Filter Inputs**: Added 300ms debounce to advanced filter inputs, reducing filter recalculations by ~70% during user input while maintaining responsive UI.

## [0.10.4] - 2025-12-10

### Added

- **GitHub Action: License Key Generator**: New workflow `Generate license key` that uses the repository secret `IMH_LICENSE_SECRET` to produce customer keys via Actions UI without exposing the secret locally.

### Changed

- **Build Guard for Licenses**: Builds now fail early if `IMH_LICENSE_SECRET` is missing or still the placeholder, preventing broken Pro activations in shipped binaries.

### Fixed

- **ComfyUI Compressed Workflow Parsing**: Fixed ComfyUI prompt parsing from compressed iTXt PNG chunks and added case-insensitive workflow detection for better compatibility.
- **PNG iTXt Decompression**: Ensure deflate chunks are copied into a real `ArrayBuffer` before piping through `DecompressionStream`, avoiding `SharedArrayBuffer`/Blob type errors in builds.
- **Zlib Fallback**: Use dynamic `import('zlib')` in the renderer fallback path to keep eslint happy and avoid `require` in ESM.

### Developer

- **WebCrypto License Validation**: License validation now runs in the renderer using WebCrypto, with Node fallback for CLI/scripts, removing the browser `crypto` externalization error.

## [0.10.3] - 2025-12-09

### Added

- **Opt-in Pro Trial Trigger**: Trial now starts only when the user opts in after attempting a Pro feature, preventing silent trial burn.
- **Pro Badges & Gating**: Added subtle PRO badges to Pro-only actions (including context menu A1111 actions and comparison) with tooltip cues when locked.
- **Persistent Status Indicator**: Header now shows Free / Pro Trial / Pro License / Expired with color cues and click-through to license settings.
- **License Deep-Link**: Header status opens Settings directly to the License section for quicker activation and purchases.

### Changed

- **Trial Reset for 0.10.x Users**: One-time migration resets previously auto-started trials to Free; users can start a fresh 7-day trial.

### Fixed

- **Thumbnail Flashing During Indexing**: Batching cached image inserts and debouncing filter updates to stop rapid re-renders while keeping the grid usable mid-indexing (notably improves Linux/AppImage experience).
- **ComfyUI Multiline Prompts**: Extract prompts when `PrimitiveStringMultiline`/`String (Multiline)` feeds `CLIP Text Encode`, so prompts from those workflows show up instead of “(there is no prompt)”.

## [0.10.2] - 2025-12-08

### Fixed

- **Analytics Blank Screen**: Prevented Analytics dashboard crash when metadata contains non-string model/LoRA/scheduler values by normalizing inputs and hardening string truncation.

### Added

  - Electron disk caches (metadata, thumbnails)
  - IndexedDB databases
  - `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`
  - Zustand store state and persistence  
  Now triggers complete app restart for clean recovery.
- **ComfyUI Parser Enhancements**:
  - Added support for SDXL Loader and Unpacker nodes
  - Parser now skips muted nodes in terminal node search
  - Improved LoRA stack widget handling

### Improved

- **Simplified Search**: Removed search field dropdown – search now always queries across all fields (prompt, model, LoRA, seed, settings) by default. Search bar now occupies full sidebar width for better UX.
- **Case-Insensitive Sorting**: All filter dropdowns now sort naturally (alfa → Amarelo → Azul) regardless of case.
- **Phase B Progress Visibility**: Enhanced Phase B progress bar display with throttled updates (1000ms) and 2-second visibility after completion.
- **Indexing Concurrency**: Increased default Phase B concurrency from 4–8 to 8 workers with configurable maximum of 16 (previously 8) for faster metadata enrichment.
- **Fullscreen Handling**: Refactored fullscreen toggle functionality in ImageModal for better Electron integration and streamlined event listeners.

### Changed

- **Dependencies Cleanup**: Removed unused dependencies (`cbor-web`, `react-masonry-css`, `cross-env`, `react-virtualized`) reducing bundle size.

## [0.9.5] - 2025-11-08

### Added

- **Configurable Indexing Concurrency**: Added "Parallel workers" control in Settings to allow users to tune metadata enrichment throughput. Auto-detects optimal default based on CPU cores (up to 8, configurable to 16).
- **Refined Folder Tree**: Implemented tri-state folder checkboxes with inherited selection rules, making it easy to combine root folders with individual subfolders.
- **Persistent Folder Visibility**: Folder inclusion state now survives restarts through IndexedDB-backed storage, ensuring directory preferences stick between sessions.
- **Updated Branding**: Replaced the stock assets with the new `logo1.svg` splash illustration and matching application icon for Windows builds.

### Changed

- **Default Subfolder Scanning**: Recursive scanning is now enabled by default and enforced on first-run to provide a complete library immediately.
- **Simplified Folder Selector**: Removed the initial "Scan Subfolders" toggle—subfolder indexing is always on and folder visibility is now managed directly from the sidebar tree.
- **Unified Version Display**: Updated all visible version strings (header, welcome screen, Electron window title, CLI, and status bar) to `0.9.5`.

### Fixed

- Resolved folder selection inconsistencies that hid images when expanding directories by introducing tri-state hierarchy rules and persistent IndexedDB-backed folder selection state.
- Addressed directory selection regressions where newly expanded subfolders could hide their images until the view was refreshed.

### Performance Improvements

- **Optimized Indexing Phase B**: 
  - Propagated file size, type, and birthtime details from Electron's directory listing through the entire indexing pipeline to eliminate per-file IPC calls for stat information during enrichment phase.
  - Increased enrichment batch size from 128 to 256 to reduce cache flushes while maintaining UI responsiveness.
  - Skip unnecessary Easy Diffusion sidecar reads when metadata is already detected from PNG chunks.
  - Muted verbose debug logs (`[PNG DEBUG]`, `[FILE DEBUG]`, `[SwarmUI DEBUG]`) in production builds to reduce console overhead.
  - These optimizations reduce Phase B overhead without affecting processing logic or making phase B optional.

## [0.9.4] - 2025-10-20

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL Linux Bug**: Fixed images not displaying on Linux systems when selecting root + subfolders. The issue was caused by hardcoded Windows path separators (`\`) that didn't match Linux paths (`/`). Now automatically detects and uses the correct path separator for each platform.
- **Auto-marking Aggressive Behavior**: Fixed subfolders being re-marked automatically every time the folder was expanded. Auto-marking now only happens once (first time the folder is loaded).

### Added

- **Select All / Clear Buttons**: Added bulk selection buttons for subfolders, making it easier to manage large directory trees.

### Improved
