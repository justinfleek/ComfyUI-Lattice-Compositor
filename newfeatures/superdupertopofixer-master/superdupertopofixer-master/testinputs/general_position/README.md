# General position cases 

This directory includes cases of objects and meshes that are in general position.
These cases are mostly easy cases that need no special treatment. They should always work.


## Inlcuded files: 

* `single_ball.obj`: one ball with center at {0.41, 0.56, 0.63} and raduis 0.25, generated by marching cubes with grid size 10 and smoothed for 200 steps. 

* `single_triangle.obj`: one "good" triangle with quite regular shape and oriented in a way to allow intersections along any axis. 

* `triangle_crease.obj`: two regular triangles sharing an edge and forming a crease. Useful for intersection detection and complex cell tests. 

* `two_balls.obj`:  two balls with centers at {0.41, 0.56, 0.63}, {0.68, 0.51, 0.48} and radia 0.25. Each ball is a different material and their intersection is a third one. 

* `two_balls_non_consecutive_materials.obj`:  same as `two_balls.obj` but with material 1 replaced by material 10 to test if the labeler handles it correctly.

* `2cubes_diag.obj`: one smaller cube nested inside the bigger one. The smaller cube is exactly the same as the big one, including material assignment. This makes small cube an invalid region. This example is useful to test that components lying fully inside the complex cell region are removed.
