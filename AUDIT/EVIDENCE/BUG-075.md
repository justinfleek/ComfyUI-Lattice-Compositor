# BUG-075: Division by Zero in ProceduralMatteLayer Animation Time

## Summary
In ProceduralMatteLayer.renderPattern(), the animation time is calculated by dividing by compositionFps. If fps is 0, this produces Infinity, corrupting all pattern animations.

## Severity: LOW

## Location
- File: /ui/src/engine/layers/ProceduralMatteLayer.ts
- Line: 186
- Function: renderPattern

## The Bug
```typescript
// Line 186
const time = this.matteData.animation.enabled ? (frame * speed / this.compositionFps + phase) : 0;
```

If compositionFps is 0:
- `frame * speed / 0` = Infinity
- All time-based animations corrupt

## Proof of Failure
```typescript
const matteLayer = new ProceduralMatteLayer(layerData);
matteLayer.setCompositionFps(0);  // Or from corrupt project

// During frame evaluation
matteLayer.evaluateFrame(10);
// Line 186: time = (10 * 1 / 0 + 0) = Infinity
// All pattern renders use Infinity time → corrupted output
```

## Impact
- All animated patterns produce corrupted output
- Gradients, noise, wipes all affected
- Low severity: Requires fps=0 (uncommon configuration)

## Related: SYSTEMIC-003
Division by fps without validation - same pattern as BUG-067, BUG-070, BUG-074.

## Suggested Fix
```typescript
const fps = this.compositionFps || 30;  // Use || to catch 0
const time = this.matteData.animation.enabled ? (frame * speed / fps + phase) : 0;
```
