# BUG-138: applyBlendModeToGroup() Silent No-Op for Meshes Without Material

## Summary
applyBlendModeToGroup() silently skips meshes that have null/undefined material. No warning or error is produced, leading to unexpected behavior where blend mode is not applied.

## Severity: LOW

## Location
- File: /ui/src/engine/layers/blendModeUtils.ts
- Lines: 127-131
- Function: applyBlendModeToGroup()

## Crash Path Trace
```
Function: applyBlendModeToGroup(group: THREE.Group, mode: string)

Line 127: if (child instanceof THREE.Mesh && child.material) {
  - child=Mesh with material=null → condition is FALSE (null is falsy)
  - child=Mesh with material=undefined → condition is FALSE (undefined is falsy)

Lines 128-131: (SKIPPED - never executed)
  - setMaterialBlendMode() is NOT called
  - material.needsUpdate is NOT set

Result: SILENT NO-OP - Mesh expected to have blend mode applied, but nothing happens
```

## Code Evidence
```typescript
// Line 126-132
group.traverse((child) => {
  if (child instanceof THREE.Mesh && child.material) {
    // ONLY EXECUTED if material is truthy
    const material = child.material as THREE.Material;
    setMaterialBlendMode(material, mode);
    material.needsUpdate = true;
  }
  // ELSE: SILENT - no warning, no error, no logging
});
```

## Scenario
1. User creates a Group with multiple meshes
2. One mesh has `material = null` (perhaps due to failed texture load)
3. User calls `applyBlendModeToGroup(group, 'multiply')`
4. Expected: Error or warning that blend mode couldn't be applied
5. Actual: Silent skip - user has no idea mesh was skipped

## Impact
- Unexpected visual results with no indication of cause
- Debugging difficult because there's no error message
- User may think blend mode was applied when it wasn't

## Suggested Fix
```typescript
group.traverse((child) => {
  if (child instanceof THREE.Mesh) {
    if (child.material) {
      const material = child.material as THREE.Material;
      setMaterialBlendMode(material, mode);
      material.needsUpdate = true;
    } else {
      console.warn(`applyBlendModeToGroup: Mesh "${child.name || 'unnamed'}" has no material, skipping`);
    }
  }
});
```
