{"comments":"Scroll Lock Utilities\n\nPure PureScript implementation of body scroll locking for modals.\nWhen a modal dialog opens, we prevent scrolling on the body to keep\nfocus on the modal content.\n\nImplementation: Adds/removes a CSS class to the document element.\nThe CSS class should define overflow:hidden in your stylesheet:\n\n```css\n.lattice-scroll-locked {\n  overflow: hidden !important;\n}\n```\n\nThis approach is preferred over inline styles because:\n1. It's more maintainable and customizable via CSS\n2. It avoids the need to track/restore original inline styles\n3. It follows the pattern used by major UI libraries (Radix, Headless UI)\n","declarations":[{"children":[],"comments":"Lock body scroll by adding the scroll-locked class\nSupports nested calls - only unlocks when all locks are released\n","info":{"declType":"value","type":{"annotation":[],"contents":[{"annotation":[],"contents":[["Effect"],"Effect"],"tag":"TypeConstructor"},{"annotation":[],"contents":[["Data","Unit"],"Unit"],"tag":"TypeConstructor"}],"tag":"TypeApp"}},"kind":null,"sourceSpan":{"end":[49,20],"name":"src/Lattice/UI/Radix/ScrollLock.purs","start":[49,1]},"title":"lock"},{"children":[],"comments":"Unlock body scroll by removing the scroll-locked class\nOnly removes class when all nested locks are released\n","info":{"declType":"value","type":{"annotation":[],"contents":[{"annotation":[],"contents":[["Effect"],"Effect"],"tag":"TypeConstructor"},{"annotation":[],"contents":[["Data","Unit"],"Unit"],"tag":"TypeConstructor"}],"tag":"TypeApp"}},"kind":null,"sourceSpan":{"end":[61,22],"name":"src/Lattice/UI/Radix/ScrollLock.purs","start":[61,1]},"title":"unlock"}],"name":"Lattice.UI.Radix.ScrollLock","reExports":[]}
