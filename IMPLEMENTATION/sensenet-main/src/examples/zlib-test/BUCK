# Example using nix_analyze rules
#
# This approach:
# 1. nix_library resolves nixpkgs#zlib to store paths
# 2. nix_cxx_binary compiles with those paths
#
# Buck2 builds the analysis graph, nix-analyze provides information.

load("@toolchains//:nix_analyze.bzl", "nix_cxx_binary")

# Build our test program
nix_cxx_binary(
    name = "zlib-test",
    srcs = ["main.cpp"],
    deps = ["nixpkgs#zlib"],
    compiler_flags = ["-O2", "-Wall"],
